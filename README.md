# Glottolog_look_up_table

This is a small repos for some R scripst that cobbles together a large tsv sheet with every languoid in Glottolog (i.e. languages, dialects and families) with various meta data. Besides the "regular" Glottolog meta data (Family, long/lat, Macroarea, Countries, etc) there are also some extra info

* descriptive status (from this [json]('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clld/glottolog3/master/glottolog3/static/ldstatus.json'))
* AUTOTYP-area (based on this [csv]("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/autotyp/autotyp-data/master/data/Register.csv"))
