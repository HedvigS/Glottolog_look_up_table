#This is a readme file for Hedvig next time she needs to render the Glottolog table form treedb

# first the glottolog repos needs to be set up properly in your clone

# if you're running on another machine than your laptop, you may need to run these first
 
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# pip install pandas


#then navigate to this folder in the glottolog repos glottolog/scripts
in terminal ni bash run

# https://github.com/clld/glottolog/tree/master/scripts

# in terminal
# python -i treedb.py

# the -i option is going to leave you in the python enviroment. Once that has finished running, you run

# >>> df.to_csv('treedb.csv', encoding='utf-8')
