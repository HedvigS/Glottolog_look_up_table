#This is a readme file for Hedvig next time she needs to render the Glottolog table form "treedb"

# first the glottolog repos needs to be up to date

# make sure that python3 is installed

# if you're running on another machine than your laptop, you may need to install pandas
 
# pip3 install pandas

# navigate to this folder in the glottolog repos glottolog/scripts
# in terminal in bash run

# python3 -i treedb.py

# the -i option is going to leave you in the python environment. Once that has finished running (which will take a while), you run

# >>> df.to_csv('treedb.csv', encoding='utf-8')
